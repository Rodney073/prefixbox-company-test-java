/*You have an array that contains strings. Every item in the array is
        unique except one which is present in the array exactly twice.
        Write a function which finds the string that is present twice in the array.
        You might assume that the input array is not null, the length is greater
        or equal to 2 and less than one million. **Strive for the low time complexity!***/
